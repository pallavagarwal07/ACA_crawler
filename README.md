IITK lan often causes proxy troubles. 
If the scripts asks you to login to Ironport, open browser and set proxy manually to ironport(1/2).iitk.ac.in:3128 
and log in. Verify that websites are opening.
Run the script again. It should work.

The number of entries are changed by dynamically changing the wikipedia url and thus less number of entries are retrieved much faster.

(Speed of script is limited by net speed, not by processing, as of now)
